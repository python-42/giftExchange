Gift Exchange custom error codes (Gift Exchange) THIS DOCUMENT MAY BE UPDATED, AND SHOULD BE UPDATED DURING ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
All of these codes indicate some sort of error. They are completely made up.
They are organized like this:
100s = File error
200s = Database error
+================+
|   100s:        |
+================+
101: File not found
Error 101 occurs when a file is missing, such as a "require" file.

+================+
|   200s:        |
+================+
201: MYSQL Connection Error
Error 201 occurs when a connection cant be established to the sql server
202: MYSQL Missing Data Error
Error 202 occurs when there is no data in a table. This might is not a significant error, and will occur often during normal operation of the site (I.e. its a notice)

Thats all I got for now, but this file should be updated when new error handling is discovered.
Users are directed to a google form to submit errors. Errors are also logged.
